# ABSTRACT
Music genre classification plays a pivotal role in enhancing the functionality of
popular music streaming platforms, encompassing music recommendation sys-
tems, personalized playlists, and content organization. With the ever-expanding
volume of music content available on the internet, the demand for efficient and
automated music classification systems becomes increasingly vital. The follow-
ing paper discusses a project for APS360 that performs music genre classification.
This is achieved by utilizing a hybrid CNN and RNN model to analyze audio clip
samples, predicting a genre from a selection of 10 possible classes.
